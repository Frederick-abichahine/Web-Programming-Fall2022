<!--
JavaScript is a scripting language, not like JAVA...

JavaScript is also called ECMASCRIPT, from it we get the abbreviation ES6, which is the most stable version of JS

Example:
    If we have a calculator:
    The HTML would be the buttons, the screen etc..
    The CSS would be resposible for the design, the colors of the buttons etc...
    JavaScript would be resposible for the logic of calculations, the dynamics and animations etc...

We can declare our functions anywhere and call them anywhere (not necessarily after declaring the function unlike python) since JS uses a compiler

<!--
DOM: Doccument Object Model

Through javascript we can access HTML.
HTML is like a tree, as we said before. We can consider the whole HTML as one object and we can traverse this tree from JavaScript

Class is for CSS
ID is for JS

Through the representation of HTML as a tree, we can use DOM to access HTML as we consider it as one object

we link to the CSS file in the head
we link the JS file at the end of the body

-->

<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1 id="my_title"> Hello World </h1> <!-- this ID should be unique in the HTML file, and we use ID for JS-->
        <h2 class="el"> Element 1 </h2>
        <h3 class="el"> Element 2 </h3>

        <script>
            //comment like this in script, JS
            //if we put the script in the head instead of the body it will read the code even before creating the object so it will give an error (NULL)
            //It is going to run head, title, then the script... in order
            //and in the script we have element.getID BUTTT there is no ID in HTML created yet so it will give a null error

            //we do not have to put ; at the end but if we put ; then we need to be consistent and put it for all. Plus, ; will let us type on the same line.

            console.log("Hello World!")
            var x = 10 //var is not the good way to do it, but for now we will be using it to start... we will use let and const for later.
            var y = 3
            console.log(y)

            //alert("Hello!") //will show a popup on the screen, not recommended to use this as it is one of the bad practices.
            //if you want to show a proper message to the user we do it in HTML later

            var str = prompt("Enter your name:")
            var element = document.getElementById("my_title") //we are accessing the HTML Object by the root and we are getting this ID
            console.log(element) //we can now access any element we want by this
            element.innerText = "Hello " + str //this will change the Hello World of HTML to your name... Now my website is dynamic

            //Difference between innerText and innerHTML
            //innerText we can not write HTML tags inside of it whereas innerHTML we can write HTML tags so it can process it such as <i></i> to make it italic etc...
            //So innerHTML will process HTML code like <div> etc...
            element.innerHTML = "<i>Hello " + str + "</i>"

            element.style.color = "red"

            if(x < 10){
                print("Smaller") //this will remain local but wont show on the console
                console.log("Smaller")
            } else{
                console.log("Larger")
            }

            for(var i=0; i<5; i++){
                console.log(i**2)
            }

            test() //unlike python, we can call the function even before declaring it... it is compiled not interpreted like python.

            function test(){
                alert("I am inside the function")
            }

            //even though ID is for JS this does not mean we can not access class from JS

            var z = document.getElementsByClassName("el") //z is an array of several elements 
            //so z.style.color = "red" DOES NOT WORK since we can not color an array red, we can fix it using:

            z[0].style.color = "red" //this will color the first elemnt of the array, to color all we need to loop

            for(var i=0; i<z.length; i++){
                z[i].style.color = "blue"
            }

            //doccument.onload will wait up until the doccuments are loaded, JUST the doccuments without videos, images etc...
            //but window.onload will wait till the entire window loads

            //window.onload = () => {} this is calling an anonymous function (a function without a name) because we only want to reference it once and never again
            //we write it inside the JS file

            //practice palindrome in JS (below)

        </script>

    </body>
