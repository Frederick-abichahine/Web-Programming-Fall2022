<!--
JavaScript is a scripting language

Example:
    If we have a calculator:
    The HTML would be the buttons, the screen etc..
    The CSS would be resposible for the design, the colors of the buttons etc...
    JavaScript would be resposible for the logic of calculations, the dynamics and animations etc...
