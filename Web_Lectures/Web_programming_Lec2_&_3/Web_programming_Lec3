Web-Programming Lec3: Git

Git is a version control system
Git tracks changes by doing math (the math (the commit) is basically at what line did we add or remove code etc...)
File is an executable item, a folder is a set of files or other folders.

There is a difference between git and github:
	- git is the tool, the logic, the algo...
	- github is the server where we can host and connect our files there.

When we commit it is still local, we did not send it to the server yet. We can commit multiple things before sending to server (push).
When we push we send the files to the server, before pushing everything is still local. Others can pull from the server to get the updated version.

There is no merging issues since you can not push if there is a new updated version so you need to pull first.

GitBash comments:
	1)	To clone a repo:
		git clone URL (the url of the repo)

	2)	To push:
		a) git add. (. means all the files)
		b) git commit -m "first commit" #put the comment, we do not need interent for this, it is local (-m is the message, and between "" is the commit message that will be visible on github)
		c) git push origin #we need internet for this comment, we need internet for this

	3)	To pull:
		git pull origin (we also need internet for this)
