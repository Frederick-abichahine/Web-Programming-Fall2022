//After creating the migration, we need to now create the models (cmd line)
php artisian 
php artisian make:Model Article
//this will create a class in model called Article
//and it will automatically create a table called articles, lowercase a and add an s...in case we want to change it we can manually do that inside Model Article by setting $table = new_name

//now we must add a route inside the API
//then inside TestController we have the methods to get the article etc...
//ex:
use App\Http\Models\Article;
function getArticles(){
	$articles = Article::all(); //we can use function all even though we did not define since this class extends Models which already has all the used functions defined
	// Selete * FROM Article
	return $articles;
};

//by extending model we mean that this this controller uses Article which is a model => Article extends model so when we use it here we get all functions in model too.
