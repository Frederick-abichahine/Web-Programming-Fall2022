//Download XAMPP, MySQL workbench & POSTMAN

workbench helps us create an ER diagram (entity relationship diagram)

Database is on the server (a server has a fixed ip address)
XAMPP is a fake server on our own machine / computer.
is a software that works on any operating system in order to create someting called a local server on our client (own pc) => our pc is now the client and server at the same time
HOWEVER, only a specific folder is acting like a server, not the whole PC (called htdocs)
We use this local server to test a database etc...

MySQL is a relational database based on relationships and structured data 
vs 
SQL is a language (structured query language)

ALWAYS the database and PHP are on the same server. It is the optimal way (to be quick).
