Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

We cannot say SQL vs MongoDB since SQL is a language and MongoDB is not!
We can say MySQL vs MongoDB
NoSQL means Not Only SQL, not no sql
Whenever we have big data it is better to use MongoDB like a social media platform
Whenever we have a structured data like LAU portal we need MySQL
Whenever we have a chatting app is it better to use NoSQL
Firebase is based on mongodb

In MongoDB we no longer have tables, we have collections / objects (JSON objects)
There are relationships in MongoDB but they are not the core!
EX:

[{ "id": 1,
  "title": "Welcome to MongoDB",
  comments: [{
		  id:1,
		  u_id:2,
		  comment:"Hey! Amazing."
		 }
		 {
		  id:2,
		  u_id:3,
		  comment:"Hey! Amazing."
		 }
		]

}]
