//never use .querySelector() when you want to get the id (use .getElementById())
//BUT when you want to get classes then use .querySelector() since according to the big O notation it is better than .getElementsByClassName() (time complexity)

//querySelector() will retrieve the first occurance of the element
//querySelectorAll() will retrieve all occurances of the element

//.querySelectorAll("#game div.boundary") //to select all the boundaries that appear after the div with class game
